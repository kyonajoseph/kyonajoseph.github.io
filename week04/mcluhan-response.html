         I had to reread this reading in order to somewhat grasp the content. But there were some parts that stood out to me such as speaking on the evolution of methods to create things. It reminds me of the progression of AI. Although I do not enjoy AI art, there’s AI in lots of applications that creatives use to create the art. AI in adobe applications to better analyze parts of the work and make the shaping quicker, or quickly adding the desired texture rather than importing and shading etc.
