      <p>I found Bush’s perspective on <strong>technology</strong> to be very interesting and hopeful. <em>I wonder how, in that day and age, with the internet constantly evolving how they managed to keep up with the sudden shift in life.</em> Technology is now a permanent part of our daily lives to increase accessibility.<br> I also wonder about the anti-technology people and how they are coping now. Reminds me of the current day and age of AI and the different opinions centered around that.</p>
