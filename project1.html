            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>
                For my motion graphics class at New York University I decided to create a music video using mainly After Effects and various self made graphics and mixed media. 
                I directed, performed, audio mixed, and edited this piece while heavily researching Y2K elements, and techniques common to R&B.

                <h3>Method 1</h3>
                <p>Whilst storyboarding I aimed to create a natural intro that would immerse the viewer into the video as the song's chorus picked up; which then led to me recording transitions of myself interacting with the camera. Within the video editing process I created a 3D logo using Adobe Illustrator to which I designed, extruded, and then match cut it into After Effects to create a glowing transition, and rolling film effect when the beat begins. </p>

                <h3>Method 2</h3>
                <p>In this scene I have a reoccuring dancing theme that is briefly forshadowed as Windows Media Encoder pops up to reveal various footage, ending with a closing transition scene of my foot covering the camera and overtaking the screen in darkness. For the Windows Media Encoder pop up I recolored it pink and added grain to match the Y2K theme. I then added a wiggle function in After Effects to add dimension and a sense of playfulness into the scene. </p>

            <div class="text-side">
                <h3>Method 3</h3>
                <p> This begins with a slowly increasing video of the outline of a stop sign to forshadow the moment the lyric of the song "Stop" is introduced. This is achieved by rotoscoping a video of a stop sign moving closer to the camera and replacing the footage with grainy glitch effects and copyright free edited videos. I then rotoscoped my feet dancing when the word "Stop" is revealed and included a video with overlaying effects in the backround of me dapping up my friend as the beat drops to replace the darkness adding complexity.  </p>

                <h3>Method 4</h3>
                <p>I began by greenscreening myself dancing, which I rotoscoped and corrected in After Effects, and as the beat progressed, the dances were replaced with scanned prints. 
                    There is also an addition of a lip-syncing side view in which a heart monitor line travels through the side view of myself into the next scene as the lyric "Heart" is sung. 
                    There is also a flickering lens flare with grain that will return in the end scene when the camera is pulled back.
                     It then transitions to a heart earring and returns to the halo effect that is created by the transition of the camera lens flare, which is pulled from a mirror revealing a held camera.</p>

                <h3>Method 5</h3>
                <p>Various color grading is done in this scene with the lips to further emphasize the Y2K aesthetic and flirty energy.
                     In addition, scans of letters jump throughout the layers of the scene to match the "Ha Ha" lyrics.
                     The TV boxes are then vibrated and wiggled to match the tempo of the song.
                     In the background video, multiple video overlays are present to create contrast. </p>

                <h3>Method 6</h3>
                <p>I rotoscoped my lips lip-syncing to the lyrics of the song and colorgraded the lips to play over a VHS style video of myself dancing.</p>

                <h3>Method 7</h3>
                <p>The song's audio does not naturally have a anticipation pause to reveal the ending of the track;
                     so I remixed the audio along with the tracks instrumental to match the lips popping out into the the screen to reveal a low angle dancing shot. </p>
