            <h3>About Martine Syms</h3>
            <p>LA-based conceptual artist whose work explores identity, media, and the relationship between Black culture and technology. She works across video, performance, publishing, and digital media often examining how identity is constructed through online interactions and cultural references.</p>
            <p>Syms attended community college for two years before moving to Chicago to study art and technology at SAIC. Upon graduating with her BFA, she cofounded Golden Age, a bookstore and project space in Chicago’s Pilsen neighborhood.</p>
            <p>She racked up tags: artist, writer, musician, publisher, teacher, filmmaker; D.J., influencer, brand. Throughout her art, her moving images feature avatars of herself that she endows with a vital mixture of ego and exhaustion, cupidity and love.</p>
            <p>She participated in exhibitions at the Museum of Modern Art, the Art Institute of Chicago, and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. She has also done commissioned work for brands such as Louis Vuitton, Prada, Nike, and Celine, among others.</p>
