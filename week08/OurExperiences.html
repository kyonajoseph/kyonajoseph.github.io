   <p>First Impressions: The site feels minimalistic, yet it carries immense depth.
It reflects both the context of the early internet and Syms’ individuality at the time.
The simplicity of language captures how words, searches, and language shape identity in the digital age.
Reflections: The piece challenges the idea that the internet is a detached, artificial space.
Instead, Syms uses it to reclaim visibility and explore identity within a social and cultural framework.
Each search term feels intimate—it reveals curiosity, emotion, and thought processes.
For example, small typos or corrections (“Let me fix that spelling”) make the experience personal and human.
Her searches show a multifaceted person: Curious, creative, bilingual (learning Spanish),
Interested in arts, film, music, affordability (“cheap,” “free”), and people.
What it made me think about: How our search histories reveal who we are—our desires, insecurities, habits, and questions.
The connection between the digital self and real-world identity. I felt oddly connected to her—as if discovering fragments of a stranger that mirror parts of myself. Made assumptions on person based on
Made me think about stereotypes, assumptions, words, etc
So interesting how even with these 2 words I sort of can know her thought process was Let me fix that spelling” it sort of connects us in a way / transports me to what she was thinking in this moment
Observations: Lived in LA and Chicago
Artistic and curious person
Spent some time learning Spanish
Into arts particularly film and music
Looking for affordable and cheap solutions “cheap, free”
Spent time looking into the PEOPLE she searched for which is fascinating !
It made me think about what *I* search for
What your searches are reveal not only what you're curious about but your interests, desires, routine, locations, so much !!
I love this concept and thinks its eye opening to conversations about connection
I wanted to know more about this artist because I felt this odd connection and like I had pieces to a missing puzzle.
